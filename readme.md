Basic Android TV application that displays a screensaver with photos.
The photos are loaded from a [photo server](https://github.com/pmarinova/photo-server) running in the local network. 
The screensaver can be enabled from Settings > Screensaver > Photos.

Idea for the original implementation was taken from this example - https://github.com/klinker41/android-dreamscene.
